## :loudspeaker: Features and Improvements

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Drastically improved container search interactions in unstable ping situations.
> Containers used to fail to open frequently in cases where client ping was unstable. The container interaction now
> accomodates this situation better now. Players should expect far fewer issues with opening containers now.
