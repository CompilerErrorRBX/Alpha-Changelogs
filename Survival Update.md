- **Introduce New Animals**:
  - 🦌 Add wildlife (deer, rabbits, etc.) as a primary food source.
  - 📉 Decrease spawn rates of packaged food items.
  - 🤖 Implement animal AI and behaviors (e.g., fleeing, grazing).
  - 🍖 Add new crafting recipes involving animal products (e.g., cooked meats).
- **Foraging System**:
  - 🌳 Add berry bushes and herb plants to different map zones.
  - 🧺 Develop a foraging mechanic (e.g., players interact with bushes/plants to gather berries or herbs).
  - 🥤 Introduce new recipes involving foraged items (e.g., berry juice, herbal remedies).

## 2. 🛠️ New Crafting and Building System
**Goal**: Introduce a structured, tiered crafting system and new stations to increase the complexity and depth of crafting.

### **Crafting Stations**
- **🔫 Bullet Press** (No tier): Essential for all ammunition crafting, providing players the means to create bullets and shells using found or crafted materials.
- **🧰 Workbench** (Tier 1): The basic crafting station for various makeshift items, armor, traps, and medical supplies. This station is versatile and serves as the entry-level crafting hub for players.
- **🔥 Campfire** (Cooking Station Tier 1): A basic cooking station that requires wood fuels to function. Can be upgraded with:
  - **🍲 Cooking Pot**: Unlocks recipes for soups, stews, and berry juice.
  - **🍖 Grill Attachment**: Allows for cooking meats and other grilled foods.

### **New Items and Recipes**
1. **💣 Grenades and Explosives**
   - **💨 Makeshift Smoke Grenade**: Crafted at Workbench (Tier 1) using common materials such as a tin can, chemical components, and cloth strips. Ideal for creating a temporary smoke screen during escapes or ambushes.
   - **⚡ Makeshift Flashbang**: Also crafted at Workbench (Tier 1). Requires a metal casing, gunpowder, and a fuse. Useful for temporarily disorienting enemies in close-quarters combat.
   - **💨 Smoke Grenade** (Looted): A more effective version of the makeshift smoke grenade. Provides a thicker and longer-lasting smoke cover.
   - **⚡ Flashbang** (Looted): A professionally made version with a more significant disorienting effect than the makeshift counterpart.

2. **🩺 Medical Supplies**
   - **🩹 SAM Splint** (Looted): Used to stabilize broken bones, reducing mobility penalties. Lightweight and fast application.
   - **💧 Water Filter**: A crafted item at the Workbench (Tier 1) requiring charcoal, plastic scraps, and cloth. Used to purify contaminated water, turning it into potable water without needing a campfire.
   - **🌑 Charcoal**: Can be crafted by burning wood at a campfire. Used in various recipes, including water filtration and basic medical treatments.
   - **💦 Stagnant Water**: Found in the environment, can be filtered with a water filter or boiled at a campfire to make it safe for drinking.

3. **🛡️ Armor and Protective Gear**
   - **🪖 Makeshift Helmet (with NVG mount)**: Crafted at the Workbench (Tier 1) using scrap metal, leather, and cloth. Provides basic head protection and allows for the attachment of night vision goggles (NVG).
   - **🦺 Crafted Body Armor**: Reworked to be crafted at Workbench (Tier 1). Requires cloth, leather, and metal plates. Provides moderate protection against projectiles and melee attacks. Could potentially have a new model to differentiate it from existing armor.

4. **🥘 Food and Drink Items**
   - **🥩 New Food Items**:
     - Various types of meat (e.g., rabbit, deer) obtained from hunting wildlife. Can be cooked on the Campfire (Cooking Station Tier 1).

   - **☕ Coffee**: Moved to the Campfire + Cooking Pot. Requires coffee beans and water. Provides a temporary stamina regeneration boost.

5. **🪤 Traps and Tools**
   - **🔗 Barbed Wire Trap**: Crafted at Workbench (Tier 1) using metal wire and scrap. Placed to deter or damage enemies in key choke points.
   - **✂️ Bolt Cutters**: A tool used to cut through barbed wire traps or other barricades. Also serves as a heavy melee weapon with a slower attack speed but high damage.

6. **🛠️ Utility and Miscellaneous Items**
   - **🔧 Makeshift Weapon Repair Kit**: Moved to Workbench (Tier 1). Crafted using scrap metal and cloth. Used to restore a portion of a weapon's durability but not permanent damage.
   - **🩺 Medkit**: Moved to Workbench (Tier 1). Crafted with cloth, alcohol, and herbal components. Used to heal wounds and provide a temporary health regeneration buff.

### **Reworked Item Crafting**
- **🔫 Ammunition Recipes**: Moved entirely to the Bullet Press station. Players will need to gather specific materials like gunpowder, casings, and bullets to craft different types of ammo, such as:
  - **Handgun Ammo**: Requires small casings, gunpowder, and lead.
  - **Rifle Ammo**: Requires rifle casings, gunpowder, and lead.
  - **Shotgun Shells**: Requires shell casings, gunpowder, and buckshot or slugs.
- **🪤 Traps**: Moved to Workbench (Tier 1). Recipes include the Barbed Wire Trap and other traps that may be added later.
- **🥘 Cooking Recipes**: Certain recipes like **Coffee** and **Berry Juice** are moved to the Campfire (Cooking Station Tier 1) with the Cooking Pot attachment, promoting the use of crafted food over found items.

## 3. ⚖️ Mid-Game Progression and Balance
**Goal**: Enhance the middle phase of the game to provide a smoother and more engaging progression curve.
