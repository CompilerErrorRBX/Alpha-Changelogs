# 🗺️ Roadmap for the Survival Update

## 1. 🌿 Survival and Crafting Overhaul
**Goal**: Deepen survival mechanics, enhance crafting's importance, and create a more balanced relationship between looting and crafting.
- **Introduce New Animals**:
  - 🦌 Add wildlife (deer, rabbits, etc.) as a primary food source.
  - 📉 Decrease spawn rates of packaged food items.
  - 🤖 Implement animal AI and behaviors (e.g., fleeing, grazing).
  - 🍖 Add new crafting recipes involving animal products (e.g., cooked meats).
- **Foraging System**:
  - 🌳 Add berry bushes and herb plants to different map zones.
  - 🧺 Develop a foraging mechanic (e.g., players interact with bushes/plants to gather berries or herbs).
  - 🥤 Introduce new recipes involving foraged items (e.g., berry juice, herbal remedies).

## 2. 🛠️ New Crafting and Building System
**Goal**: Introduce a structured, tiered crafting system and new stations to increase the complexity and depth of crafting.
- **Crafting Stations**:
  - 🏗️ Design and implement new stations:
    - 🔫 Bullet Press (No tier)
    - 🧰 Workbench (Tier 1)
    - 🔥 Campfire (Cooking Station Tier 1 with upgradeable attachments)
  - 🖥️ Develop crafting UI enhancements to accommodate new stations.
- **Blueprints and Progression**:
  - 📜 Create blueprint drops for key recipes to slow progression slightly and add a sense of accomplishment.
  - 🧭 Implement blueprint acquisition through exploration.
- **New Items and Recipes**:
  - 💣 Add new items such as makeshift grenades, filters, barbed wire traps, etc.
  - 🔄 Rework existing item crafting (e.g., moving ammo crafting to Bullet Press).

## 3. ⚖️ Mid-Game Progression and Balance
**Goal**: Enhance the middle phase of the game to provide a smoother and more engaging progression curve.
- **Adjust Loot Spawn Rates**:
  - 🚫 Reduce the abundance of loot (especially firearms) to extend early-game survival.
  - 🛠️ Tune spawn rates of crafting materials and components.
- **Item Durability and Permanent Damage**:
  - 🛡️ Introduce a permanent damage system for all items, reducing their lifespan and serving as an item sink.
  - 🗑️ Implement a “junk” version for destroyed items to encourage crafting and recycling.
- **Per-Life Stat-Based Progression System**:
  - 📈 Design a system where players earn passive bonuses (e.g., slight stamina boosts) per life based on activities (e.g., crafting, foraging, combat).

## 4. 🗺️ Map and Exploration Improvements
**Goal**: Encourage exploration and improve the natural flow of player movement across the map.
- **Rebalance Map Layout**:
  - 🧭 Adjust points of interest (POIs) to encourage movement across the entire map.
  - 🎯 Place key crafting components or blueprints in less-visited areas to drive exploration.

## 5. 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics Adjustments
**Goal**: Increase the challenge and realism of survival mechanics.
- **Movement Speed Penalties**:
  - 🐢 Apply penalties during crafting, healing, or other actions to add risk during these activities.
- **Durability Changes**:
  - 🪓 Introduce permanent durability loss mechanics for weapons and items.
  - ♻️ Allow destroyed items to be recycled into scrap materials.

## 6. 📢 Communication and Player Engagement
**Goal**: Prepare players for the update and encourage engagement.
- **Pre-Update Announcements**:
  - 📅 Announce the upcoming loot wipe and major changes at least one week in advance.
  - 📬 Use in-game notifications and community channels to keep players informed.
- **Feedback and Testing**:
  - 🧪 Run a public test environment (PTE) phase to gather feedback on the new mechanics.
  - 📊 Conduct surveys and gather data on player experiences post-update.

## 7. 🔍 Post-Update Monitoring and Adjustments
**Goal**: Monitor the impact of the changes and refine the gameplay experience.
- **Monitor Player Feedback**:
  - 📊 Track player metrics (e.g., playtime, crafting usage, exploration patterns).
  - 🛠️ Review community feedback and address critical issues or exploits.
- **Regular Patches**:
  - 🩹 Plan for quick patches to address balance issues, bugs, and unintended consequences.
