# Roadmap for Major Game Update

## 1. Survival and Crafting Overhaul
**Goal**: Deepen survival mechanics, enhance crafting's importance, and create a more balanced relationship between looting and crafting.
- **Introduce New Animals**:
  - Add wildlife (deer, rabbits, etc.) as a primary food source.
  - Decrease spawn rates of packaged food items.
  - Implement animal AI and behaviors (e.g., fleeing, grazing).
  - Add new crafting recipes involving animal products (e.g., cooked meats).
- **Foraging System**:
  - Add berry bushes and herb plants to different map zones.
  - Develop a foraging mechanic (e.g., players interact with bushes/plants to gather berries or herbs).
  - Introduce new recipes involving foraged items (e.g., berry juice, herbal remedies).

## 2. New Crafting and Building System
**Goal**: Introduce a structured, tiered crafting system and new stations to increase the complexity and depth of crafting.
- **Crafting Stations**:
  - Design and implement new stations:
    - Bullet Press (No tier)
    - Workbench (Tier 1)
    - Campfire (Cooking Station Tier 1 with upgradeable attachments)
  - Develop crafting UI enhancements to accommodate new stations.
- **Blueprints and Progression**:
  - Create blueprint drops for key recipes to slow progression slightly and add a sense of accomplishment.
  - Implement blueprint acquisition through exploration.
- **New Items and Recipes**:
  - Add new items such as makeshift grenades, filters, barbed wire traps, etc.
  - Rework existing item crafting (e.g., moving ammo crafting to Bullet Press).

## 3. Mid-Game Progression and Balance
**Goal**: Enhance the middle phase of the game to provide a smoother and more engaging progression curve.
- **Adjust Loot Spawn Rates**:
  - Reduce the abundance of loot (especially firearms) to extend early-game survival.
  - Tune spawn rates of crafting materials and components.
- **Item Durability and Permanent Damage**:
  - Introduce a permanent damage system for all items, reducing their lifespan and serving as an item sink.
  - Implement a “junk” version for destroyed items to encourage crafting and recycling.
- **Per-Life Stat-Based Progression System**:
  - Design a system where players earn passive bonuses (e.g., slight stamina boosts) per life based on activities (e.g., crafting, foraging, combat).

## 4. Map and Exploration Improvements
**Goal**: Encourage exploration and improve the natural flow of player movement across the map.
- **Rebalance Map Layout**:
  - Adjust points of interest (POIs) to encourage movement across the entire map.
  - Place key crafting components or blueprints in less-visited areas to drive exploration.

## 5. Gameplay Mechanics Adjustments
**Goal**: Increase the challenge and realism of survival mechanics.
- **Movement Speed Penalties**:
  - Apply penalties during crafting, healing, or other actions to add risk during these activities.
- **Durability Changes**:
  - Introduce permanent durability loss mechanics for weapons and items.
  - Allow destroyed items to be recycled into scrap materials.

## 6. Communication and Player Engagement
**Goal**: Prepare players for the update and encourage engagement.
- **Pre-Update Announcements**:
  - Announce the upcoming loot wipe and major changes at least one week in advance.
  - Use in-game notifications and community channels to keep players informed.
- **Feedback and Testing**:
  - Run a public test environment (PTE) phase to gather feedback on the new mechanics.
  - Conduct surveys and gather data on player experiences post-update.

## 7. Post-Update Monitoring and Adjustments
**Goal**: Monitor the impact of the changes and refine the gameplay experience.
- **Monitor Player Feedback**:
  - Track player metrics (e.g., playtime, crafting usage, exploration patterns).
  - Review community feedback and address critical issues or exploits.
- **Regular Patches**:
  - Plan for quick patches to address balance issues, bugs, and unintended consequences.

## Timeline
