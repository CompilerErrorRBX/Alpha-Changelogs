## 📢 Features and Improvements

### ✅ `Feature` Added `Weight` stat to inventory UI
- Displays the player's current carry weight.

### 🔼 `Improvement` [QOL] When crafting equipment items, they are now automatically equipped.
> This follows the same set of rules as picking up items. For example, if you craft a backpack
> and this backpack has more space than one you're currently using, it will equip the new backpack.
> Otherwise it will be placed in your inventory or dropped if there is no space.

### 🔼 `Improvement` [QOL] When picking up another inventory item your existing items are preferred.
> Before this change, when picking up a full backpack from a corpse, your items in your backpack would be dropped on the ground in favor of the items in the corpse backpack.
> This is now flipped, so your items will be moved into the corpse backpack and any items that don't fit anywhere in your inventory will be dropped on the ground.
