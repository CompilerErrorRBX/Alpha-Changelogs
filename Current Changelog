# üìë Changelog 01/27/2025 - xx/xx/xxxx

## ‚≠ï Status `Unreleased`

## üí¨ Patch Notes
With this update we wanted to focus a bit on quality of life. Crafting weapons now auto equip, and swapping inventory-backed items now prioritize the inventory that was originally equipped.
Bows had some changes as well, making them a bit better all around.
We also felt that with the recent balance changes that weapons did not spawn in residential areas enough, so we increased the spawn rate a bit.

## üì¢ Features and Improvements

### ‚úÖ `Feature` Added `Weight` stat to inventory UI
- Displays the player's current carry weight.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] When crafting equipment items, they are now automatically equipped.
> This follows the same set of rules as picking up items. For example, if you craft a backpack
> and this backpack has more space than one you're currently using, it will equip the new backpack.
> Otherwise it will be placed in your inventory or dropped if there is no space.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] When picking up another inventory your existing items are preferred.
> Before this change, when picking up a full backpack from a corpse, your items in your backpack would be dropped on the ground in favor of the items in the corpse backpack.
> This is now flipped, so your items will be moved into the corpse backpack and any items that don't fit anywhere in your inventory will be dropped on the ground.
- Attempts to maintain item previous order, if possible.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] Reworked keybind system
> Addresses several limitations of the old system, like keybinds only being bindable to a single control, no alt bindings,
> inability to fire a keybind in certain cases where UI takes priority, inability to set the activation style of a keybind.
> To address another issue that's been around for a few weeks where there remains some players with corrupt keybinds, we're resetting all player keybinds
> to default to fix that and to set up for the new system. We apologize for the inconvenience here, but we do feel the added control is worth it.
- Adds support for multi-key bindings where players can assign as many keys as they want to a keybind to perform the action.
- Adds support for activation styles, such as `Press`, `Release`, `Toggle`, `Hold`. i.e. Sprint could be changed from `Toggle` to `Hold`.
- Adds better support for keybind prioritization, where the `ContextActionService` lacks. (ex. Console players would crouch while pressing B/O while their inventory was open)
- Reworked default console keybinds to flow a bit better.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] Players now try to stand or crouch when attempting to sprint while prone.
> Previously, when sprinting while prone, the character would simply "sprint" while in the prone pose.

### üîº `Improvement` [Performance/QOL] Reworked Interaction System
- [Performance] Improved performance of interaction system in large item clusters. Thousands of items should be unnoticable now.
- [QOL] Interactions now utilize only one keybind.
- [QOL] Timed interactions are now toggled instead of held. (Click `E` to start and `E` again to cancel)
- [QOL] Holding `E` will open a radial menu for additional interactions if more exist. (i.e. Lock Door, Kick Door, etc.)
