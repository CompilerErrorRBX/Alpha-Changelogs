# üìë Changelog 01/27/2025 - xx/xx/xxxx

## ‚≠ï Status `Unreleased`

## üí¨ Patch Notes
With this update we wanted to focus a bit on quality of life. Crafting weapons now auto equip, and swapping inventory-backed items now prioritize the inventory that was originally equipped.
Bows had some changes as well, making them a bit better all around.
We also felt that with the recent balance changes that weapons did not spawn in residential areas enough, so we increased the spawn rate a bit.

## üì¢ Features and Improvements

### ‚úÖ `Feature` Readded ADS while in third person.

### üîº `Improvement` Improved player animations
- Reworked 3rd person animation system to allow for far more animations.
- Added animations for eating, drinking, bandaging, etc (we'll add more as we make them).

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] Reworked keybind system
> Addresses several limitations of the old system, like keybinds only being bindable to a single control, no alt bindings,
> inability to fire a keybind in certain cases where UI takes priority, inability to set the activation style of a keybind.
> To address another issue that's been around for a few weeks where there remains some players with corrupt keybinds, we're resetting all player keybinds
> to default to fix that and to set up for the new system. We apologize for the inconvenience here, but we do feel the added control is worth it.
- Adds support for multi-key bindings where players can assign as many keys as they want to a keybind to perform the action.
- Adds support for activation styles, such as `Press`, `Release`, `Toggle`, `Hold`. i.e. Sprint could be changed from `Toggle` to `Hold`.
- Adds better support for keybind prioritization, where the `ContextActionService` lacks. (ex. Console players would crouch while pressing B/O while their inventory was open)
- Reworked default console keybinds to flow a bit better.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] Reworked Chat UI
- Requirement from Roblox that the new TextChatService API is used. See [Roblox Requirement](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/migrate-to-textchatservice-removing-support-for-legacy-chat-and-custom-chat-systems/3237100)
- Dropped support for emoji autocomplete (For now. Maybe we can revisit this later.)

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] Reworked Settings UI
> Utilizes the new keybind system with support for combo keybinds.
- Trying out a new layout for UIs in the game, which we think will be much smoother to use.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] When crafting equipment items, they are now automatically equipped.
> This follows the same set of rules as picking up items. For example, if you craft a backpack
> and this backpack has more space than one you're currently using, it will equip the new backpack.
> Otherwise it will be placed in your inventory or dropped if there is no space.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] When picking up another inventory your existing items are preferred.
> Before this change, when picking up a full backpack from a corpse, your items in your backpack would be dropped on the ground in favor of the items in the corpse backpack.
> This is now flipped, so your items will be moved into the corpse backpack and any items that don't fit anywhere in your inventory will be dropped on the ground.
- Attempts to maintain item previous order, if possible.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] Players now try to stand or crouch when attempting to sprint while prone.
> Previously, when sprinting while prone, the character would simply "sprint" while in the prone pose.

### üîº `Improvement` [Performance/QOL] Reworked Interaction System
- [Performance] Improved performance of interaction system in large item clusters. Thousands of items should be unnoticable now.
- [QOL] Interactions now utilize only one keybind.
- [QOL] Timed interactions are now toggled instead of held. (Click `E` to start and `E` again to cancel)
- [QOL] Holding `E` will open a radial menu for additional interactions if more exist. (i.e. Lock Door, Kick Door, etc.)

### üîº `Improvement` Various Performance Optimizations
- Improved performance of character movement and collisions by ~15%.
- Improved performance of all player animations.
- Improved speed of player character loading by ~80%.
- Improved speed of algorithm which finds items within item render distance by ~30%.
- Improved several building models to optimize occlusion culling. Yields ~75% fewer draw calls and triangles on the optimized buildings.
- Reduced graphical triangle counts by up to 97% in many areas of the map.
- Removed a badly performing Roblox script that was inserted when a player joined.
- Items dropped on the ground in partial stacks will now combine with nearby similar item stacks on the ground.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] Improved tree collisions
- Vehicles will no longer collide with tree branches.

### üîº `Improvement` [QOL] Cars will no longer freeze while in the air
- Typically caused by an exploiter being kicked while trying to fly a car.
- Cars should now fall all the way to the ground.

### üîº `Improvement` Various small improvements
- [QOL] Improved first person view position in cars.
-- Camera also more closely follows your head position when going up and down hills.
- [QOL] Added a voice chat status effect to display when a player is voice chatting.
