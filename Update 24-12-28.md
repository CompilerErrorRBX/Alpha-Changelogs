## 💬 Patch Notes
This update we wanted to expand a bit more on crafting and fresh-spawn gameplay. The crafting interface has received an overhaul, which should help to address many of the previous iterations shortcomings.
Additionally, we have changed some crafting recipes for early game items. It is much easier to craft a Makeshift hatchet, allowing makeshift weapons to be crafted a bit faster.

> Intended to provide freshies with more ability to run long distances (due to low carry weight)
> and to encourage the usage of caffeine items for geared players.
- Stamina drain now scales on total carried weight of the player.
- Drain algorithm: `(0.5 + 0.078 * kg) / second`.
- Drain algorithm (new weight metric) `(0.5 + 7.8 * μ) / second`

### ✅ `Feature` Added a Return to Main Menu option in the tabs bar.
