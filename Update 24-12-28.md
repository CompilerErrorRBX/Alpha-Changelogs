# :bookmark_tabs:  Changelog 12/26/2024 - 12/28/2024

## :green_circle: Status `Released`

## :speech_balloon: Patch Notes
This update we wanted to expand a bit more on crafting and fresh-spawn gameplay. The crafting interface has received an overhaul, which should help to address many of the previous iterations shortcomings.
Additionally, we have changed some crafting recipes for early game items. It is much easier to craft a Makeshift hatchet, allowing makeshift weapons to be crafted a bit faster.
