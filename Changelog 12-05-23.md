### :white_check_mark: `Feature` Shop
- Used for purchasing an equipment airdrop, and more later.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Interaction Improvements
> We found that interacting with certain objects was very difficult, as the system was unable to validate that you actually had line of sight to larger objects like cars and desks, so we've attempted to improve the logic around determining if you can truly see what you're interacting with. This is still imperfect, but it should make many previously impossible interactions possible.
> Additionally, we improved the responsiveness of how line of sight is determined, so the interactions you're trying to reach should be much easier to reach.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Scrap context menu action no longer closes context menu
> Trying to scrap many items was very burdensome since it required you to right click on the item
> and then click scrap over and over. Instead of that, we've made it so the context menu stays open and you can keep on clicking.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Player graves remove when emptied.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Nearby explosions cause concussions.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` New ACOG reticle.
