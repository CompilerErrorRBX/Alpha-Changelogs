## :loudspeaker: Features and Improvements

- *Some* items with durability can now be combined.

> This improvement moves the application of these status effects to AFTER you press the spawn button.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Grenade improvements
> We'll add the ability to "cook" a grenade in the near future.
- Grenades roll much less now.
