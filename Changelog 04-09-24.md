## :loudspeaker: Features and Improvements

### :white_check_mark: `Feature` Automatic server restarts.
> While we work to address memory leaks causing server crashes, we've added an automated server restart to help alert players that a restart is coming soon.
- Servers restart after 10 hours.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Improved bunker hatch door functionality.
> A common pain point when going into the bunker was that players would try to get on the ladder going into the bunker
> but when they did this they would accidentally interact with the hatch door and close it. We've changed this behavior
> so that the hatch door cannot be interacted with, instead we added a crank inside of the hatch which can be used to open/close the door.
