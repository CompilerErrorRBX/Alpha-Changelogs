## :speech_balloon: Patch Notes
Merry Christmas! This week we are rolling out our Title Screen implementation. This should address issues with console players being unable to join specific servers.
Included in the update is a revamp of the crafting UI. We hope this helps users better understand what is required to craft, and improve the overall experience.
