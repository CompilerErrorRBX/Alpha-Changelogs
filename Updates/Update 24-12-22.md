# :bookmark_tabs:  Changelog 12/15/2024 - 12/22/2024

## :red_circle: Status `Unreleased`

## :speech_balloon: Patch Notes
Merry Christmas! This week we are rolling out our Title Screen implementation. This should address issues with console players being unable to join specific servers.
Included in the update is a revamp of the crafting UI. We hope this helps users better understand what is required to craft, and improve the overall experience.

Common Questions:
## 
Q: Does this mean loot is only saved on a specific server instance?

A: Not yet. We plan on enabling this functionality after our loot wipe inearly 2025
## 
Q: Can I create private servers now?

A: Not yet. With this being an initial implementation, we want to first flesh out all of its shortcomings before allowing users to host their own servers.
