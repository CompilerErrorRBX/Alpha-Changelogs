## :loudspeaker: Features and Improvements

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Network improvements
- Zombie initialization network packet now scales on `O(log(m)*n)` from `O(m*n)` (about 85% smaller packet size in the current case. From `~133KB` -> `20KB`)
- Zombie update network packet size reduced by `~30%`
- Zombie update network usage reduced by over `90%` (a bug was inflating this number significantly).
- Character network packet size reduced by `~90%`

## :bug: Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug which caused a hangup on the server which broke server/client initialization in rare cases.
- Fixed a bug which incorrectly calculated maximum zombie update packet size, incorrectly sending way more data than it should.
- Fixed a bug where zombie update data was sent over the network unnecessarily. Likely a small boost to server performance here.
- Fixed a bug which prevented the bleeding sound and particles from stopping after death.
