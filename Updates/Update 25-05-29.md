# üìë Changelog 05/20/2025 - 05/29/2025

## üü¢ Status `Released`

## üí¨ Patch Notes
Continuing to work on improving the little details that seem off, as well as fixing various frustrating bugs.

Most notably, we added our first permanent event in the game. A Blackhawk will fly over the map occasionally carrying high value loot.
If shot down, players can steal the loot from the crash. Such a loud event is likely to attract a lot of attention.
