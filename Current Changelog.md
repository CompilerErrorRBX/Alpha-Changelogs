# 📑 Changelog 07/17/2025 - 07/xx/2025

## 🟢 Status `Unreleased`

## 💬 Patch Notes

This update we are heavily focused on some changes to help aleviate the effects of cheaters in the game. While we do not normally get in to the technical details of this kind of development, know that we are working on it as much as we can!
We are also looking in to our vehicle system, and building out features for that to better match the survival aspect of the game. Cars no longer instantly elevate you above other players upon finding them.
Players must now gather materials before cars can be driven. Cars now require a `Battery`, `Sparkplug`, `Fuel`, and `Car Keys` to be operational. They also now come with storage so you can carry more loot with you!
