# :bookmark_tabs:  Changelog 04/15/2024 - 04/19/2024

## :green_circle: Status `Released`

## :speech_balloon: Patch Notes
This week we spent a bit of time on addressing some more frustrating bugs,
we also added a few items into the spawn pool and optimized a few processes.

We felt there were a few too many .50 BMG weapons in the loot pool, so we reduced their natural spawn rates.
Statistically speaking, the .50 BMGs are far more likely to be from natural spawn than they are to be from airdrops.

## :loudspeaker: Features and Improvements

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Character movement and collision improvements
- Improved how characters behave when walking off a ledge.
- Improved how characters behave on slopwed terrain in general.
- Improved collisions when walking off of a sloped ledge.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Cleaned up some squad notification logic
- Removed the redundant "Invite Closed" message when a player joins a squad.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Minor server performance improvements
- Cleaned up some looping code to make it run more efficiently, should provide some smoother frames on the server.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Ground item optimizations
- Cleaned up some legacy workflows with ground items which reduces their overall part count.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Accuracy of most relevant interactables
> Previously, it could be difficult to interact with an item ontop of a cabinet for example.
> This improvement helps to, once again, prioritize the interactable that's under your mouse cursor.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` 10/22 Takedown gunshot far sound
> Previously 10/22 Takedown did not play a far gunshot sound. This has been changed.
> The sound travels less far than other guns sound, due to its low caliber.
> This applies to the new MK4 pistol as well.
