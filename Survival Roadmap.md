  - 🦌 Add wildlife (deer, rabbits, etc.) as a primary food source.
  - 📉 Decrease spawn rates of packaged food items.
  - 🤖 Implement animal AI and behaviors (e.g., fleeing, grazing).
  - 🍖 Add new crafting recipes involving animal products (e.g., cooked meats).
- **Foraging System**:
  - 🌳 Add berry bushes and herb plants to different map zones.

  - 🥤 Introduce new recipes involving foraged items (e.g., berry juice, herbal remedies).

## 2. 🛠️ New Crafting and Building System
**Goal**: Introduce a structured, tiered crafting system and new stations to increase the complexity and depth of crafting.

### **Crafting Stations**
- **🔫 Makeshift Bullet Press** (No tier): Essential for all ammunition crafting, providing players the means to create bullets and shells using found or crafted materials.
- **🧰 Makeshift Workbench** (Workstation Tier 1): The basic crafting station for various makeshift items, armor, traps, and medical supplies. This station is versatile and serves as the entry-level crafting hub for players.
- **🔥 Campfire** (Cooking Station Tier 1): A basic cooking station that requires wood fuels to function. Can be upgraded with:
  - **🍲 Cooking Pot**: Unlocks recipes for soups, stews, and berry juice.
  - **🍖 Grill Attachment**: Allows for cooking meats and other grilled foods.
- **🛠️ Makeshift Forge**: (Metalworking Station Tier 1) crafting station required for crafting more advanced metal items, such as the Cooking Pot, Grill Attachment, and metal weapons, mertal plates. Built using scrap metal on a workbench, fueled with charcoal.

### **New Items and Recipes**
1. **💣 Grenades and Explosives**
   - **💨 Makeshift Smoke Grenade**: Crafted at Workbench (Tier 1) using common materials such as a metal can, chemical components, and cloth scraps. Ideal for creating a temporary smoke screen during escapes or ambushes.
   - **⚡ Makeshift Flashbang**: Also crafted at Workbench (Tier 1). Requires a metal can, gunpowder, (need something else here to actually cause the flash). Useful for temporarily disorienting enemies in close-quarters combat.
   - **💨 Smoke Grenade** (Looted): A more effective version of the makeshift smoke grenade. Provides a thicker and longer-lasting smoke cover.
   - **⚡ Flashbang** (Looted): A professionally made version with a more significant disorienting effect than the makeshift counterpart.

2. **🩺 Medical Supplies**
   - **🩹 SAM Splint** (Looted): Used to stabilize broken bones, reducing mobility penalties. Lightweight and fast application.
   - **💧 Water Filter**: A crafted item at the Workbench (Tier 1) requiring charcoal, plastic scraps, and cloth scraps. Used to purify contaminated water, turning it into potable water without needing a campfire. (Perhaps this recipe is too easy?)
   - **💦 Stagnant Water**: Found in the environment, can be filtered with a water filter or boiled at a campfire to make it safe for drinking.

3. **🛡️ Armor and Protective Gear**
   - **🪖 Makeshift Helmet (with NVG mount)**: Crafted at the Workbench (Tier 1) using scrap metal, leather, and scrap cloth. Provides basic head protection and allows for the attachment of night vision goggles (NVG).
   - **🦺 Crafted Body Armor**: Reworked to be crafted at Workbench (Tier 1). Requires scrap cloth, leather, and makeshift armor plates. Provides moderate protection against projectiles and melee attacks. Could potentially have a new model to differentiate it from existing armor.

4. **🥘 Food and Drink Items**

   - **🩺 All Medkits**: Moved to Workbench (Tier 1).
   - **🍲 Cooking Pot**: Potentially looted from camps or houses. Can be used to cook advanced recipes like soups and stews. In future updates, players could craft the Cooking Pot using a Forge and metal scraps.
   - **🔥 Grill Attachment**: Used to upgrade the Campfire (Cooking Station Tier 1) for cooking grilled foods.

7. **⚙️ Major Crafting Components**
   - **🌑 Charcoal**: Can be crafted by burning wood at a campfire, or found throughout the world. Used in various recipes, including water filtration, metallurgy, and basic medical treatments.
   - **🧵 Metal Wire**: Crafted at Forge (Tier 1) Crafted from metal scraps. Used for crafting traps (e.g., barbed wire trap) and other makeshift items..
