## :loudspeaker: Features and Improvements


### :white_check_mark: `Feature` FEATURE

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Client Performance Improvements

- Deferred loading on ground items, containers, doors, etc.

## :balance_scale: Changes

### :exclamation: `Change` Last location is now only saved to the specific server instance the player played on.
> This change should prevent players from leaving the server, joining another and moving, then rejoining the server to be in a different location.
> The future state of this system will be almost everything being saved to the specific server (persisted on the server list). In the meantime we felt this was a good way to prevent the "move location on an empty server" strat.

## :bug: Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug which made it so all of a player's outfit was removed upon death.
- Fixed a bug where players had an invisible infection in a certain case.
