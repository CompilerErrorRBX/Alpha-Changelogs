## :loudspeaker: Features and Improvements

### :white_check_mark: `Feature` Combat Log Penalties
- Added a really basic combat log penalty until the more ideal system is ready.

### :white_check_mark: `Feature` Added Bullet Collaterals to Zombies
- Bullets can pen zombies and hit zombies behind them now.

### :white_check_mark: `Feature` Vehicle Overhaul
> Not our final vision for cars by any means, but we felt cars were really lacking. So we spent some time improving their physics.
- Cars take damage now.
- Zombies no longer walk through cars (excluding when a player drives through them).
- Zombies attack cars.
- Cars should no longer free momentarily when shot.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Item Spawn System Rework
- Refactored spawn logic to be identical between containers and ground items.
- Improved flexibility of complex spawn logic.
- Improved performance of item respawning.
- Ground items can now spawn in groups (i.e. a gun with boxes of ammo that belong to it next to eachother)

## :balance_scale: Changes

### :exclamation: `Change` Increased spawn rate of Chinese Soldier Zombie by 1000%.

### :exclamation: `Change` Temporarily disabled last location saving in servers.
> Players were abusing the fact that while loading in, the buildings around them weren't fully visible yet and being able to see players through walls.
> So we've disabled location saving to prevent relogging in the same spot to abuse this from occurring.

- Fixed a bug which caused rain to never happen.

- Fixed a bug which caused melee to do no damage to players.
- Fixed a bug which prevented ground items and container items from being removed when the Chinese bunker POI doors closed.
- Fixed a bug which caused one of the attachment slots to be missing for a weapon, also allowing it to fire without consuming ammo.
- Fixed a bug which caused some containers to show the wrong items. Occasionally, some players might see an empty container while it has items for others.
