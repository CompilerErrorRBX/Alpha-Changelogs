## :loudspeaker: Features and Improvements

### :white_check_mark: `Feature` Combat Log Penalties
- Added a really basic combat log penalty until the more ideal system is ready.

### :white_check_mark: `Feature` Added Bullet Collaterals to Zombies
- Bullets can pen zombies and hit zombies behind them now.

### :white_check_mark: `Feature` Vehicle Overhaul

- Cars take damage now.
- Zombies no longer walk through cars (excluding when a player drives through them).
- Zombies attack cars.
- Cars should no longer free momentarily when shot.

### :arrow_up_small: `Improvement` Added instructions to Chinese Bunker.

## :balance_scale: Changes

### :exclamation: `Change` Increased spawn rate of Chinese Soldier Zombie by 1000%.

### :exclamation: `Change` Temporarily disabled last location saving in servers.
> Players were abusing the fact that while loading in, the buildings around them weren't fully visible yet and being able to see players through walls.
> So we've disabled location saving to prevent relogging in the same spot to abuse this from occurring.
